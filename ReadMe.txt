"Multiple Independent Semantic Text Selection Using Pressure"

Includes a C++ bridge to Java. The bridge folder is called DIY.

The hardware for this year is a pressure-sensitive, multitouch touchpad from Synaptics, code named "Jedeye". The pre-production prototype features high resolution, independent tracking of pressure and location for up to 5 fingers.

*NOTE* 
-> Need to include Synaptics lib and include folders from their SDK.
-> TextSelection_UIST_Processing is a processing-2.0b3 prototype sketch
-> TextSelection is a Java project
-> UIST_2012_SIC_Java is a Java project using sound
